## The Primary Questions
:::{.incremental}

1. Which species are at risk? 

\ 

2. How big is that risk?  

\ 

3. How can we mitigate that risk?
:::

## Ecological Forecasting

-   We can't predict the future

-   **Stochasticity** and **uncertainty** are inherent in the system

**Sub-question 1:**

-   How do environmental **stochasticity** and climate change **uncertainty** affect estimates of **risk** to biodiversity?
:::
::::::

## Defining Terms
:::{.incremental}

- **Risk:** the probability of unwanted consequences resulting from a specific action

- **Stochasticity:** when the outcome of a process is not entirely predictable

- **Uncertainty:** what we don’t know, or can’t predict 
  - Outcomes 
  - **Assumptions** about how the system works

- **Sensitivity:** The degree to which a change in **assumptions** affects estimates of risk
:::

## Objectives 

- Examine uncertainty from: 

  - Spatio-temporal variability in wildfire 
  
  - Effects of increasing wildfire from climate change 
  
  - Stochasticity in seismic line regeneration 
  
\ 
  
- See how these uncertainties affect estimates of breeding habitat availability for migratory songbirds

## Transition Probabilities

-   Succession
    -   Adapted from CFS work (Diana Stralberg’s team)
-   Fire
    -   Derived from Cumming (2006) & CFS work
-   Harvest
    -   Derived from Al-Pac FMP
    -   Used growth and yield curves and AAC

## Anthropogenic Disturbance

-   Baseline Disturbances:
    -   Residential, agriculture, major roads, railways
-   Oil Sands Disturbance
    -   Hard disturbances
        -   Industrial sites, mines, etc…
    -   Soft disturbances
        -   Seismic lines, well pads, minor roads, pipelines

## Scenarios

![](3_outputs/tables/scenarios.png)

## Seismic Line Regeneration

-   Used Alberta ecosite classes and Lidar data to create simple models of the annual probability of a seismic line becoming regenerated.  
\  

-   Regenerated was defined as having a canopy height of 3m (sensu van Rensen et al. 2015) 

\ 

- Erased due to fire or harvest

## We Looked at 3 Metrics

1.  Deterministic estimates of future populations  
\ 

2.  Risk of population decline relative to baseline scenario  
\ 

3.  Risk of declines between 2% and 20%, relative to baseline scenario

## Key Takeaways 

1. Forest species at high risk of decline 

\ 

2. Climate change greatly increases uncertainty 

\

## Seismic Restoration Scenario (Sensitivity Analysis)

![](3_outputs/figures/seismic-restore.png)

## Questions we can ask with Sensitivity Analysis 

1. How does increasing seismic regeneration rates by X% affect risk estimates? 

2. What proportion of seismic lines do we need to restore to reduce risk by X%? 

3. How do different spatial arrangements of restoration affect risk estimates? 


## A More Robust Tool 

Estimate risks probabilistically 

\ 

Can test how different assumptions affect risk estimates  

- Sensitivity analysis is *critical*

***Uncertainty is OK!*** - as long as we account for it

## Risk Assessment -- because we can't predict the future

\  

### 1. Defining Risk

-   Requires us to define an **‘unwanted outcome’** 

\ 

### 2. Decision-making context

-   **Risk Tolerance:** The probability threshold below which we are unwilling to accept the negative outcomes of an action

## Risk Avoidance 

Regulatory Triggers 

\ 

Cost Control 

\ 

Social License 

## Next Steps 

1. Adapt simulations to the ABMI species models and use for automated predictions  
\ 

2. Update development to include new oil sands development: 
New seismic lines, wells, processing facilities, roads, pipelines, etc…  
\ 

3. Look into developing more sophisticated habitat models 
Include landscape context, population processes (colonization/extinction)
